        <p class="about">Life Teen is a Catholic youth ministry organization 
            for high school teens led by 
            the Holy Spirit to take teens where they are right now 
            and lead them to Christ through the Eucharist.
            The goal of Life Teen is to provide a safe 
            and fun place for youth to find a solid Catholic community, 
            get answers to their questions, and, most importantly, 
            to experience Jesus in a profound and personal way.</p>
